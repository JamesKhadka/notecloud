              Welcome to my portfolio. Meet James Khadka, a 24-year-old from Damak, Nepal, who's currently rocking his BSc CSIT studies. I'm not just about hitting the books though, James lives for football and volleyball, and is pretty awesome at both. But that's not all â€“ also a smooth talker with a knack for making friends wherever he goes. When he's not on the field or hitting the books, you'll find him exploring new places and soaking in different cultures. James is the ultimate go-getter who's always up for a challenge and ready to make every moment count!
